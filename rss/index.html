I passed the JLPT N4 (equivalent to the upper elementary level, or A2/B1 in CEFR level) in 2016 &#x2014; but since then I haven&#x2019;t taken any serious studying besides the occasional pattern: download an interesting app related to Japanese learning; use the app for a week or two; work gets busy; forgot to use the app at one point and never use it again (to the extent that&#x2019;s it&#x2019;s still installed till now).</p><p>As I am now on a <a href="https://enreina.com/blog-reboot-what-am-i-if-i-am-not-a-software-engineer/">career break</a>, thus having no excuse like &#x201C;work gets busy&#x201D; anymore, I have decided to <em>seriously</em> improve my Japanese this year.</p><p>To &#x201C;gauge&#x201D; the improvement, &#xA0;I decided to take the JLPT N3 (equivalent to Intermediate Level, or B2/B2 in CEFR level). Signing up for the exam is not easy here. The quota is limited here in Indonesia, and the exam is very popular. The website always crashes when registration is open. Thankfully I managed to sign up and secure a seat for the July exam.</p><p>The exam result has just recently come out. I passed the exam, though not with an outstanding score, I acquire the N3 certificate nevertheless. It really gives the assurance that I&#x2019;ve actually made a progress in improving my Japanese.</p><p>In this post, I want to share how I studied, especially on the resources that I use and how I incorporate habit building to ensure I study Japanese every day (well, <em>almost</em> every day) &#x2014; with the JLPT N3 in mind as a goal/checkpoint.</p><h3 id="what-is-jlpt">What is JLPT?</h3><p>JLPT stands for Japanese Language Proficiency Test, or in Japanese it&#x2019;s referred as <em>Nokken</em> (shorten from <em>Nihongo Nouryouku Shiken)</em> is the most popular test to evaluate one&#x2019;s level of Japanese. It has 5 levels, from N5 as the easiest to N1 as the hardest. I won&#x2019;t go into more details about JLPT, but if you&#x2019;re interested and want to know more I&#x2019;d recommend reading an article on Tofugu: <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/what-is-the-jlpt/">What is The JLPT?</a></p><h3 id="my-learning-style">My Learning Style</h3><p>It might help to describe a bit about my learning style before jumping to the resources that I use to study Japanese.</p><p>I mentioned earlier that I passed the N4 level around 6 years ago, and even then my learning of the Japanese language is a mix between formal classroom study and self-study. After passing the N4, I dropped (i.e. didn&#x2019;t continue) all forms of classroom study. Since then, I&apos;ve continued to learn Japanese by myself in my leisure time. Before this year, it was really just a &#x201C;hobby&#x201D; &#x2014; studying Japanese on the side with no particular goal in mind, with no structured habit or so.</p><p>Only by this year, I decided to study more seriously, exposing myself to more of the Japanese language, and researching the appropriate resources that suit my learning style.</p><p>Also, I&#x2019;d really recommend reading this write-up by u/SuikaCider that they shared on Reddit: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/10bRzVblKVOsQJjTc2PIi1Gbj_LrsJCkMkh0SutXCZdI/edit">A Year to Learn Japanese</a>. It has incredible details on stages of learning Japanese that I wished I read in my early years of Japanese learning.</p><h3 id="resources">Resources</h3><p>Alright, without further ado, here&#x2019;s a list of resources that I&#x2019;ve been using. Disclaimer: I&#x2019;m not affiliated with any of the products, and these are what work for me (and they may not work for everyone).</p><ul><li><strong><a href="https://wanikani.com/">WaniKani</a></strong>. A web application for learning kanji and vocabulary that I wished I use when I started learning Japanese. It&#x2019;s not free, but I think it&#x2019;s really worth it. It sets you up with a ready-to-use <a href="https://www.tofugu.com/japanese/spaced-repetition/">SRS</a> system and mnemonics, and you can just focus on what really matters: learning &amp; memorizing kanji. I&#x2019;ve fairly learned more kanji in the 8 months of using WaniKani than in the 8 years of Japanese study (well, to be fair the studying in those 8 years wasn&apos;t intensive).</li><li><a href="https://www.kaniwani.com/"><strong>KaniWani</strong></a><strong>. </strong>This is a companion website to WaniKani. Where reviews in WaniKani present us a kanji (or vocab) where we have to answer with its meaning and reading, KaniWani presents us the English vocab and asks us to answer in Japanese. I&#x2019;m not sure if this helps with the JLPT exam, as in the exam it&#x2019;s more about comprehension (input) rather than output &#x2014; but if you&#x2019;d like to be able to reproduce words, knowing the English equivalent, I&#x2019;d still recommend using KaniWani along with WaniKani.</li><li><a href="https://bunpro.jp/"><strong>Bunpro</strong></a><strong>.</strong> Another web application (yeah! I love these apps) that also uses the SRS method, but for memorizing grammar points (<em>bunpou</em>, hence the app name <em>bunpro</em>). The grammar points are also nicely organized according to their JLPT level, so you can jump straight to N3 if you already know N5 &amp; N4 grammar.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Practice-Questions-Japanese-Language-Proficiency/dp/4872179412"><strong>Shin Nihongo 500 Mon N3</strong></a><strong> (&#x65B0;&#x306B;&#x307B;&#x3093;&#x3054;&#xFF15;&#xFF10;&#xFF10;&#x554F;N3)</strong>. A friend that has already passed N3 kindly lent me this exercise book. The book &#x2014; as the title indicates &#x2014; has 500 questions on kanji characters (&#x6587;&#x5B57;), vocabulary (&#x8A9E;&#x3044;), and grammar (&#x6587;&#x6CD5;). What I really like is how the book is organized: every page has a total of three questions, one for each language aspect, and on the back of the page we can immediately read the correct answer and a brief explanation. You&#x2019;re expected to work on 15 questions (5 of each language aspect) each day, and by the end of every week, you would count the number of correct answers. If you only have a few correct answers, you&#x2019;re encouraged to repeat and go through the questions all over again.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nihongo-Somtome-Reading-NIHONGO-SO-MATOME/dp/4872177665">Nihongo Soumatome N3 Dokkai</a> (&#x65E5;&#x672C;&#x8A9E;&#x7DCF;&#x307E;&#x3068;&#x3081;N3&#x8AAD;&#x89E3;). </strong>The Shin Nihongo 500 Mon that I mentioned previously is actually a companion to the main &#x7DCF;&#x307E;&#x3068;&#x3081; (<em>soumatome</em>) set for JLPT study. The set has five books for each JLPT level covering grammar, kanji, reading comprehension, vocabulary, and listening comprehension. I only have the book for practicing reading comprehension (<em>dokkai</em> / &#x8AAD;&#x89E3;). I actually bought the book <em>after</em> I&#x2019;d already taken the N3 exam. In the exam, I had to randomly guess the answers to around 8 reading questions because time was running out. Knowing that I really need to improve my reading speed, I bought the book and have been doing the reading exercise daily since then.</li><li><strong>YouTube.</strong> I mostly use YouTube to watch grammar explanations when I had a hard time understanding the grammar point on Bunpro. For grammar, I&#x2019;d recommend the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/nihongonomori2013">&#x65E5;&#x672C;&#x8A9E;&#x306E;&#x68EE; (Nihongo No Mori)</a> channel. Aside from learning grammar, I also recommend watching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC-l_ELvToJsP_eeDfm7m36Q"><strong>Manga Fermilab</strong></a>. They present and discuss informative things using manga videos with Japanese dub, so you can learn reading and listening at the same time while also learning interesting topics.</li><li><strong>Anime</strong>. I used to be an avid anime watcher when I was younger, and haven&apos;t watched that much for some time. But because of the pandemic, I&#x2019;ve recently just started watching them again. I watch most anime on Netflix and Bstation (a.k.a Bilibili). When I watch them, I try to turn off the subtitle or turn on the Japanese closed caption whenever it&#x2019;s available. Even when I just want to relax and ended up using the English subtitle, I still get an &#x201C;aha&#x201D; moment whenever I recognized a new word that I&#x2019;d just recently learned.</li><li><strong>Novels / Stories / Manga in Japanese</strong>. What I have read (or currently reading) in Japanese so far:</li></ul><ol><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PLHP7MZ/">&#x661F;&#x306E;&#x738B;&#x5B50;&#x3055;&#x307E;&#xFF08;</a></strong><em><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PLHP7MZ/">Hoshi no Ouji Sama</a></strong></em><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07PLHP7MZ/">).</a></strong> It&#x2019;s the Japanese version of &quot;The Little Prince&#x201D; (originally in French I believe). I picked up the book because it&#x2019;s fairly short and I&#x2019;ve already read the English version a couple of times. I also listened to the audiobook, but unfortunately, the edition between the audiobook and the book that I own is different, so I couldn&#x2019;t read along with the audio.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Japanese-Short-Stories-Beginners-Captivating/dp/1951949226"><strong>Japanese Short Stories for Beginners</strong></a>. I think this is one of those books which gives you a sense of accomplishment for early Japanese learners. It consists of 20 short stories, and at the end of each story, there are questions to ensure your comprehension.</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/195194934X/"><strong>Intermediate Japanese Short Stories</strong></a><strong>.</strong> This is from the same publisher of Japanese Short Stories for Beginners, it has the same format but consists of only 10 short stories with more difficult words.</li><li><strong><a href="https://bookwalker.jp/de271303de-3f95-4280-a6d7-724777a8860d/">Happiness (&#x30CF;&#x30D4;&#x30CD;&#x30B9;) Volume 1</a></strong>. This is a manga I read along with the <a href="https://community.wanikani.com/t/master-list-of-book-clubs/35283">WaniKani book club</a>. I haven&#x2019;t continued to the next volume yet, as the story does not quite suit my taste. But it does not have much dialogue, so it&#x2019;s a very nice light read for people who want to try reading manga in Japanese for the first time.</li><li><strong><a href="https://www.amazon.co.jp/%E5%A4%9C%E3%82%AB%E3%83%95%E3%82%A7-1-%E8%AC%9B%E8%AB%87%E7%A4%BE%E9%9D%92%E3%81%84%E9%B3%A5%E6%96%87%E5%BA%AB-%E5%80%89%E6%A9%8B-%E7%87%BF%E5%AD%90/dp/4065134749">Yoru Kafe (&#x591C;&#x30AB;&#x30D5;&#x30A7;) Volume 1</a></strong>. &#xA0;This is a light novel that I read also as part of the WaniKani book club. Unfortunately, I&#x2019;ve only managed to read up to chapter 6, and I haven&#x2019;t picked it up again because I&apos;m not engaged enough with the story. I may pick it up again when I&#x2019;m in the mood later (and maybe ended up like it, who knows).</li></ol><ul><li><strong>Podcast</strong>. I also sometimes try to listen to Japanese podcasts. My favorite podcast is called <a href="https://nihongoswitch.com/">Nihongo Switch</a>. It is intended for intermediate to advanced learners and is 100% in Japanese. It also helps that the host provides transcripts for each episode on her website, so I can read along the transcript while listening to the episode.</li><li><strong><a href="https://japanesetest4you.com/category/jlpt-n3/jlpt-n3-listening-test/">JLPT N3 Listening Exercises available on jtest4you</a></strong>. For listening exercises intended for the JLPT exam, I use this website. It has around 22 sets, though I didn&#x2019;t actually go through it all by the day of the exam. The exercises help to give a sense of what the listening section would be like in the exam.</li><li><strong><a href="https://jlptbootcamp.com/2013/02/the-official-jlpt-n3-practice-workbook/">JLPT N3 Practice Test &amp; Workbook</a>. </strong>I use this practice test and workbook around two weeks before the exam to get me used to the exam sections and ensure I can adhere to the time limit (this is when I&#x2019;ve also realized that I&#x2019;m still slow on the reading section).</li></ul><p>That seems to be quite a lot of resources, right? Luckily (or unfortunately?) for Japanese learners, the resource available online are abundant. But that also means there is too much to explore, and we might be compelled to keep &#x201C;searching&#x201D; until we got the &#x201C;right&#x201D; one for us. Or even trying to study using too many things at the same time. I think it&#x2019;s best to just stick to two or three things for a certain period of time, like a week or two. If you feel like you&#x2019;re improving, then continue. If you feel like it&#x2019;s not helping with your study, feel free to drop it or pick it up again for a later time.</p><h3 id="timeline">Timeline</h3><p>Here&#x2019;s the rough timeline of my journey toward the JLPT N3 Exam:</p><ul><li><strong>End of January</strong>: Researching and trying out several resources and decided which one to use continuously</li><li><strong>February</strong>: Start using WaniKani &amp; KaniWani</li><li><strong>March</strong>: Start using Bunpro</li><li><strong>April</strong>: Sign up for the JLPT</li><li><strong>May</strong>: Start working on the exercises in Shin Nihongo 500 Mon N3</li><li><strong>June</strong>: Try out the JLPT N3 Practice Test &amp; Workbook</li><li><strong>July</strong>: Took the JLPT exam. I almost couldn&#x2019;t take the exam, because I was recovering from COVID (I caught it 2 weeks before the exam, yikes, such luck!). But in the end, I managed to recover and was able to take the exam.</li><li><strong>August</strong>: JLPT Result &#x2014; Unexpectedly I passed! As expected, my lowest score is in the reading section: with only 26/60 points (thankfully the sectional passing grade is 19 points). I guess the fact that I passed was contributed by how I did in the other sections &#x2014; I got 36/60 and 46/60 for language knowledge (vocab &amp; grammar) and listening respectively. It&#x2019;s not an outstanding score, I know, but I&#x2019;m still very happy that I actually passed.</li></ul><h3 id="habit-building">Habit Building</h3><p>Alright, the post title says &#x201C;How I Build a Habit&#x201D;, but really how I did do it &#x2013; you ask? I have been mostly trying to apply what I&#x2019;ve learned from reading <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299">Atomic Habits</a> &#x2014; it&#x2019;s a great book about habit building in general. But TLDR &#x2014; I try to keep the following principles to build my habit:</p><ul><li><strong>Try to it do every day, even if it&#x2019;s just a minute</strong>. There are days that I&#x2019;m too lazy and don&#x2019;t have the motivation to study. This is when I try to remind myself, that even if it&#x2019;s just a minute &#x2014; just do it, either by reviewing a single kanji or listening to a short Japanese podcast.</li><li><strong>If I miss a day, don&#x2019;t sweat &#x2014; just make sure to pick it up again the next day</strong>. If I do end up missing a day without any study, I have to keep it in mind the next day. In order to not break the &#x201C;habit chain&#x201D;, I try to not miss a habit more than a day.</li><li><strong>Keep a daily journal</strong>. A daily journal really helps to keep track of my progress and gives me a sense of small accomplishment every day. It also supports the previously mentioned mindset to do the habit every day &#x2014; whenever I have an &#x201C;empty&#x201D; log that day, I would have the itch to fill it out by studying even just for a minute.</li></ul><p>With those principles in mind, I gradually include the above-mentioned resources in my daily studying schedule. I first started by using only WaniKani every day for a couple of weeks. After I feel that the habit starts to stick (i.e. I don&#x2019;t need to gather up much effort to start using it each day), I add KaniWani to my daily study. I do the same thing as well for Bunpro and textbooks. In the end, I ended up with the following routine that has settled for quite a while now:</p><ul><li>5.30 AM &#x2014; wake up; feed the cat; and go for a walk</li><li>8.00 AM - 9.00 AM &#x2014; Brew coffee &amp; breakfast</li><li>9.00 AM - 10.00 AM &#x2014; Read any of the designated Japanese reading materials (novels, manga, or textbooks). I also incorporate non-Japanese books (English or Indonesian) for leisure to avoid burnout</li><li>10.00 AM - 12.00 AM &#x2014; I start reviewing Kanji, Vocabs, and Grammar on WaniKani, KaniWani, and Bunpro</li><li>13.00 AM &#x2014; 16.00 AM &#x2014; After lunch, I usually pick one (or more) of these: watching Anime, YouTube (either &#x65E5;&#x672C;&#x8A9E;&#x306E;&#x68EE; or FermiLab), and/or listening to some Japanese podcast</li><li>Throughout the day I occasionally checked in to WaniKani/KaniWani/Bunpro every two to three hours to do reviews. Especially at the beginning, I used to do reviews on WaniKani almost every two hours (it was very addictive at the beginning, believe me). But now, I&#x2019;ve reduced the reviewing time to around once or twice daily.</li></ul><h3 id="what-to-do-next">What to Do Next</h3><p>There are a couple of things that I&#x2019;d like to do next:</p><ul><li><strong>Practicing output (i.e. speaking and writing)</strong>. JLPT doesn&#x2019;t test speaking and writing ability so even though I&#x2019;ve passed the exam, I honestly don&#x2019;t feel comfortable yet if I had to converse 100% in Japanese. This is what I&#x2019;m trying to work on from now on &#x2014; I&#x2019;m currently looking at several options like trying out <a href="https://www.italki.com/en">italki</a> or other similar platforms.</li><li><strong>Road to N2</strong>. I haven&apos;t stopped using WaniKani and Bunpro even after the exam as I&#x2019;m aiming for N2 as my end goal (for now). Maybe passing the N2 in December is a bit far-fetched considering the difficulty, but I will try to sit in the December exam just to check how well I&#x2019;m doing so far. Hopefully, I can write a post soon about my journey towards N2.</li></ul>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Career Break and Blog Reboot: What am I, If I am Not a Software Engineer?]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>6 months ago, I resigned from my job and decided to take an indefinite break from my software engineering career.

It was not an overnight decision. On the contrary, I came to the decision after constant self-doubt, built up over the last 3&#x2013;4 years throughout my master&apos;s study and my day-to-day job as a software engineer.</p><p>The burning questions were, and probably still are: <em>What am I, if I am not a software engineer? What do I do if software engineering, and might as well, tech in general, is stripped away from me?</em></p><p>I have been a self-proclaimed tech enthusiast for most of my life. In high school&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;or even way before&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I always knew that I wanted to have an occupation in the tech industry, not specifically as a software engineer, but I just wanted to <em>code</em> for a living. But not long after I could proudly say &#x201C;I am a software engineer&#x201D;, I started to have some self-doubts&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I&#x2019;m not really sure if I want or am suited, to work in the tech industry for a lifetime.</p><p>I just lost the spark and the enjoyment that I used to have when I code to build things. It was not fun anymore. I didn&#x2019;t know when it started being a burden, but at one point, every morning I woke up, I dread the thought of having to work like that for the rest of my life. I tried to convince myself that working is not always about having fun, it&#x2019;s just a part of being an adult<em>.</em> However, there was always an inner voice that kept saying that it wouldn&#x2019;t be fair to anyone, especially myself if I continue to work like that.</p><p>Then I realized: if I do end up with the answer to the question, &#x201C;What am I? What do I do ( <em>for a living</em>)?&#x201D;, I would then label myself solely as one thing&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;my job&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;and it would lead to the same problem with how I&#x2019;ve labeled myself as a software engineer until now. I see myself as someone who couldn&#x2019;t do anything at all outside the tech world. That was the main thing that has been holding me back from quitting the tech industry&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I was afraid that I would be nothing if that one sole identity was stripped away from me.</p><p>So, after trying to hold on for quite some time, I decided to take a leap of faith and pluck up the courage to take a break from my career. Although I wouldn&#x2019;t say I have &#x201C;quit&#x201D; the tech industry, I&#x2019;m still glad that I had the resolve to let go. For me at that time, letting go means resigning from a well-paying job overseas and moving back to my home country.</p><p>So, there I was. Back to square one. Unsure of what to do next.</p><p>However, once I put software engineering out of the equation, it&#x2019;s easier to realize that I do have other things that I could do&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;or for a better phrasing&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;things that I <em>would</em> like to do.</p><p>It turns out that I enjoy doing many kinds of things, from reading books, playing the piano, watching movies &amp; animation, to learning a language. I am no expert at any of these things, but I enjoy them nonetheless. The interest comes and goes as a cycle&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;one time I could really spend a whole week learning a piece on the piano, and then I could spend another week trying to read a <em>manga</em> in Japanese.</p><p>After around 6 months of being unemployed, with the first 2 months spent on traveling and getting settled back in my home country, I gradually settled into a routine. My days are filled with things I sincerely enjoy doing. I start my day with a morning walk, then brew a cup of coffee, take a course on music theory, brush up my Japanese, and so on. I really feel that the weight on my shoulder has been lifted&#x200A;&#x2014;&#x200A;I could now take my time to do the things that I <em>want</em> to do and not the things that I <em>have </em>to do.</p><p>However, I am still not quite sure where all of this will take me, so there is still some anxiety left about the future. That&#x2019;s why I try to have some kind of progress tracker by writing a <em>sabbatical</em> journal about the things I do and learn every day. The journal helps me to give a self-affirmation that I am still moving forward, albeit slowly.</p><p>The reboot of this blog is, in a way, an expanded version of that journal.

I want to treat myself better by giving myself a chance to take a break from all the stress and explore other things outside the tech industry. I just want to have faith that all of these would lead to something: either recovering my passion for tech or paving the way to an entirely different career path.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[To Be an MSc Student or Not to Be, That Is the Question — or Is It?]]></title><description><![CDATA[How much time should you be committed to something so you can claim yourself as “a commmited person”?

Even I dropped out of &#x2018;formal&#x2019; elementary school &#x2014; which supposed to take 6 years in Indonesia &#x2014; after finishing 4th grade.</p><blockquote>How much time should you be committed to something so you can claim yourself as &#x201C;a commmited person&#x201D;?</blockquote><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://enreina.com/content/images/2022/03/msc-yes-no.png" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy" width="300" height="295"><figcaption>MSc: Yes or No?</figcaption></figure><p>My office work was no better. I have 2 real work experiences listed on my CV (real as in employed by a certain company), and the longest one was my most recent one prior to my master study: 1.5 years of working as a software engineer for a friend-turned-into-CEO&#x2019;s startup company.</p><p>The first few months of work were exciting for me, I got to learn new things every day with new challenges to solve. But then &#x2014; as clich&#xE9; as it may seem &#x2014; nothing lasts forever. The excitement tones down as every day&#x2019;s activities turn into routines, and I feel like my skill set was not growing. It&#x2019;s just the same thing I had to do every day. It was boredom.</p><h3 id="msc-as-an-alternative-%E2%80%9Ccareer%E2%80%9D-path">MSc as an Alternative &#x201C;Career&#x201D; Path</h3><p>That was when I started to consider taking another path: taking a master degree. Again, my reason was not solely because &#x201C;I want to gain more knowledge..and so on&#x201D; (well it is true to some extent), but it was mostly because I felt stuck on the same position and needed a change of pace.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s why I decided to take a chance by working on my application to an MSc programme. As I wasn&#x2019;t really sure on what specialization that I would want to take back then, I slimmed down my university options to one &#x2014; <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft</a> &#x2014; which offers an <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/cs/msc-computer-science/">MSc in Computer Science programme</a> without strict specialization (at least when we start, by the second year we need to decide in which research group we&#x2019;d like to work our thesis in).</p><p>Then, I also started to seek possible scholarship options, back then the options were either <a href="https://www.lpdp.kemenkeu.go.id/">LPDP</a>, Beasiswa Menkominfo, and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/scholarships/justus-louise-van-effen-excellence-scholarships/">TU Delft Excellence Scholarship</a>. Note that taking an MSc degree without scholarship would not be an option for me, it was way more reasonable for me to figure out how to not get bored in my job while being paid, rather than spending a fortune for a Master degree just to be &#x201C;not bored&#x201D;.</p><p>There was another condition which I imposed on myself: I had to work as hard as possible to get accepted &#x2014; if by the end I didn&#x2019;t get admitted and/or didn&#x2019;t acquire a scholarship, I would take it as a sign that MSc was not the way for me.</p><h3 id="results">Results?</h3><p>I honestly felt really lucky back then: the first time was when I got my acceptance letter and the second time was when my scholarship application got nominated and eventually be selected as one of the Excellence Scholarship recipients. My application for the Menkominfo scholarship was in fact got rejected, which I almost took a sign to give up on my pursuit towards a graduate study.</p><h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3><p>This post is not the kind of post like &#x201C;many failures come before success&#x201D; type of post. This post is just to show that sometimes you don&#x2019;t really need a strong &#x201C;why&#x201D; to do something. You <em>just have to do it</em> &#x2014; even boredom can be the most &#x2018;logical&#x2019; reason for you to take a step forward.</p><blockquote>Sometimes for some people, you don&#x2019;t have to have a &#x201C;reason&#x201D; to take a graduate degree (or any other life choices). &#x201C;Just because.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>No, I am not saying that you should take a master degree if you&#x2019;re bored with your current job (<em>gosh,</em> you should be grateful you actually have a job). A master degree is not for everyone. It is also not necessary. It&#x2019;s just if you feel stuck &#x2014; just like me back then &#x2014; do check your available options.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sakura]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>What&#x2019;s your reason for coming to japan?<br><br>I want to see the cherry blossom blooms in Japan with my own eyes.</p><p>And yes the dream was worth a wait.

I don&#x2019;t know since when I had this dream to see the cherry blossom blooms in Japan, but maybe because of watching many beautifully drawn anime with cherry blossom in it (e.g. <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907/http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/5_Centimeters_Per_Second">5 centimeters per second</a>), the idea of seeing it with my own eyes has been in my mind for a long time.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/blossom-300x225.png" class="kg-image" alt="A vector image of cherry blossom that I made with Inkscape long ago." loading="lazy"><figcaption>A vector image of cherry blossom that I made with Inkscape long ago.</figcaption></figure><p>It was a matter of time that I got to fulfill this one dream (or bucket list, if I may say it) of many others. &#xA0;I was really excited (and nervous) when April was coming because the sakura were going to bloom around end of March until beginning of April. Seeing sakura for me is like seeing lanterns for Rapunzel (yes I am referring to Disney&#x2019;s movie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/">Tangled</a>).</p><blockquote><em><strong>Rapunzel</strong>: I&#x2019;ve been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky.

Let&#x2019;s get on to some photos! My favorite photos were taken along Kanda River (&#x795E;&#x7530;&#x5DDD;) from Takaido Station to Meidaimae Station. It was around 4.5 km (one and a half hour walking if you often stop and take some photos) between those stations and it was an amazing morning walk to see and experience showers of sakura petals.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4495-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Sakura along the Kanda River." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sakura along the Kanda River.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/https://dl.pushbulletusercontent.com/DUQZ5EI90sQXDvPTKf74cjlzeoWqPvxV/IMG_20150406_075620.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>It&#x2019;s like a scene out of an anime.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4532-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Close up version of pale pink version of sakura" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Close up version of pale pink version of sakura</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4556-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Sakura petals shower make the road look like it&apos;s covered with pink carpet." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sakura petals shower make the road look like it&#x2019;s covered with pink carpet.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4563-e1428329748228-225x300.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="&apos;Weeping&apos; sakura" loading="lazy"><figcaption>&#x2018;Weeping&#x2019; sakura</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4568-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A pinker version" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A pinker version</figcaption></figure><p>Other than Kanda River, I also went to Ueno Park (just strolling along the park, because it was too crowded to sit down), Asukayama Park (hanami with several YSEP students), and also just today I went to Yoyogi Park (hanami with other several YSEP students). Oh there are actually also some cherry blossom in Tokodai (Ookayama campus). I didn&#x2019;t take many photos at those places and were just enjoying the blissful moment.

So yeah basically I am going to start writing in English from time to time especially when writing about my story here in Japan as a YSEP Student. I was putting off this blogging in English thing for weeks now because I feel most comfortable writing in &#x2018;informal&#x2019; Indonesian language (which I always use when I write previous posts in this blog), but for the sake for my blog to be read by non-Indonesian, I&#x2019;ll try my best.</p><p>If you are reading my blog for the first time (or you don&#x2019;t understand the previous posts which are in Indonesian), let me introduce myself for a bit.</p><p>My name is Enreina Annisa Rizkiasri, but people usually calls me Enreina or Reina (either is fine). I am currently a fourth year bachelor student in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia and also right now an exchange student at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech or Tokodai). I am participating the Young Scientist Exchange Program Focused On Research and belongs to Murata Laboratory, Department of Computer Science in Tokodai. The program will last for a year so I have many things to blog about life as an exchange student in Japan.</p><p>So it has been like almost 50 days that I have been living in Yokohama-shi (it&#x2019;s actually 48 days, I know, I have been counting it with my phone&#x2019;s lock screen widget). I came to Japan on the 12th of September (and if you understand Indonesian and would like to know my first three days in the country, you should read my previous blog post) which is the day I arrived at Haneda Airport. I arrive there with three other YSEP students from Indonesia (Bima, Baim, and Antya) and was met by my Lab Tutor, Hosokane Aiko-san. There were actually two more YSEP students from Indonesia which are Dyah and Vidya. The first one, Dyah, is my roommate in the dorm and she had arrived a day earlier, while the later, Vidya, is Antya&#x2019;s roommate and arrived two weeks later.</p><p>In Yokohama-shi, I live in Umegaoka Dormitory (a dormitory for foreign Tokyo Tech students) which is located near Fujigaoka station (15 minutes walk from there actually if you walk moderately fast over hills, because yeah the road consists of up-hills and down-hills). It was tiring at first going back and forth between dorm and the station, but I got used to it right now and it&#x2019;s actually a nice habit. I kinda enjoy morning walks right now from the dorm to the station.</p><p>I got a double room in the dormitory (which I shared with Dyah), and the room is really nice and neat. There are also a microwave, a washing machine, a kitchen already in the room. So yeah, basically I already feel comfortable living in the dormitory.</p><p>From dormitory to Tokyo Tech O-okayama campus (intermezzo: the o in O-okayama &#xFF08;&#x5927;&#x5CA1;&#x5C71;&#xFF09;is actually three Os so it&#x2019;s pronounced really long like &#x201C;o-o-o&#x201D; haha) is around 1 hour by train. I had to take the Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line and change to the Tokyu Oimachi Line to reach O-okayama station from Fujigaoka station. It&#x2019;s not too far once I got used to commute here and there. And again I enjoy the time that I spend for my everyday&#x2019;s commute.</p><p>I actually have so many things to tell about living in Japan from my lab, shopping, eating, sightseeing, home stay, and much more! But I think it won&#x2019;t fit into this one post, so I&#x2019;ll just keep this one short (for introduction only).</p><p>See you!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saat Kuliah Menjadi Hobi]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Akhirnya muncul lagi di blog ini, dengan theme baru &#x1F600;</p><p>Gue baru saja menyelesaikan dua minggu pekan UTS Semester 4 lho.

Yep, gue udah berada di pertengahan semester 4, alias nggak lama lagi gue bakal jadi mahasiswa tingkat 3 di semester depan. Wow, memang kalau kita melakukan hal-hal yang menyenangkan, waktu terasa lebih cepat ya?</p><p>Nah ada apa ini dengan judul post-nya &#x201C;Saat Kuliah Menjadi Hobi&#x201D;? Ya itu dia, gue mau cerita tentang bagaimana gue sekarang menganggap kuliah itu menjadi hobi. Kuliah itu bisa dibilang sebagai passion gue sekarang. Kok bisa?</p><p>Jadi ceritanya, gue baru-baru ini baca tentang post ini: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140112093533/http://rinaldimunir.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/pidato-wisudawan-terbaik-memukau-tetapi-sekaligus-menakutkan/">http://rinaldimunir.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/pidato-wisudawan-terbaik-memukau-tetapi-sekaligus-menakutkan/</a> yang kebetulan juga linknya sudah tersebar dan populer di media sosial seperti Twitter dan Facebook.</p><p>Dari pidato tersebut, gue langsung teringat bagaimana dulu gue sangat menentang kata-kata &#x201C;Kan yang penting nilainya ..&#x201D; dan seakan-akan semua kerja keras para pelajar hanya dapat dilihat dari nilai saja. Bahkan sejak SD, gue jadi memiliki rasa &#x2018;takut&#x2019; yang berlebihan akan nilai, dan hasilnya adalah gue keluar dari sekolah dasar saat awal kelas 5, dan memutuskan untuk <em>homeschool</em>.</p><p>Sayangnya, rasa &#x201C;takut&#x201D; itu masih terbawa sampai SMP, padahal nilai-nilai gue bisa dibilang baik-baik saja dan membuat orang-orang bingung apa yang membuat gue begitu takut.</p><p>Selama 10 tahun melalui &#x2018;pendidikan&#x2019; sebelum kuliah, <em>mindset</em> gue tentang sistem pendidikan di Indonesia yang salah belum hilang sepenuhnya. Gue menganggap pendidikan itu hal yang menyeramkan yang memaksa pelajar untuk mengejar satu objektif, yaitu nilai. Sedangkan menurut gue, bukankah pendidikan itu seharusnya menjadi fasilitas negara agar kita bisa merasakan betapa menyenangkan mencari ilmu itu?</p><p>Nah, baru setelah masuk ke kuliah, yang bisa dibilang jurusan yang gue ambil adalah <em>passion</em> gue, gue baru benar-benar merasakan bahwa ilmu itu menyenangkan, dan kuliah pun menjadi hobi bagi gue yang gue tunggu kejutan-kejutannya setiap hari. Gue nggak mau lagi menganggap nilai itu adalah segalanya, malahan nilai itu hanya menjadi patokan untuk lebih meningkatkan pemahaman. Apalagi di Ilmu Komputer, banyak banget ilmu yang gue dapet di luar dari perkuliahan itu sendiri &#x1F600;</p><p>Learning is supposed to be fun, right? &#x1F600;</p><p>-zero&amp;one,</p><p>Enreina A.

Entah mungkin karena hari Sabtu adalah awal dari weekend, atau karena ya beda deh suasana sekitar pas Sabtu pagi datang &#x1F604; (halah). Sekarang gue mau nge-sok nulis tentang &#x201C;Gagal vs Berhasil&#x201D;.</p><p>Selama gue hidup sampai sekarang ini (hayah baru umur 16 tahun aja ngesok &#x2018;selama gue hidup&#x2019; :p), gue sering banget ya nemu banyak orang merasa &#x2018;gagal&#x2019; trus tiba-tiba udah ngomong-ngomong hal-hal yang <em>depressing</em> banget, kesannya kayak dunia ini udah berakhir aja.</p><p><em>Well,</em> ya emang maklum sih semua orang juga pasti pernah ngerasain kayak gitu, gue pun juga pernah kok. Malah kalau di-<em>flashback</em>, banyak banget kejadian-kejadian yang waktu itu rasanya gue udah nggak ada harapan lagi, tapi toh malah sekarang gue malah mikir-mikir gara-gara kejadian-kejadian itu lah gue jadi seperti yang sekarang ini. Optimis dan penuh determinasi.</p><p>Kalau yang baru-baru ini terjadi (sebenernya udah hampir setengah tahun yang lalu) adalah &#x2018;gagal&#x2019;-nya gue diterima di PTN melalui SNMPTN Jalur Undangan. Yang ngebuat gue waktu itu merasa benar-benar gagal adalah bagaimana gue superrrrr banget berharap keterima lewat jalur itu, dan sama sekali nggak kepikiran bakal bisa melalui SNMPTN Jalur Tertulis. Awalnya, rasanya bener-bener hopeless deh. Mungkin juga karena gue jarang menghadapi kekecewaan-kekecewaan sebelumnya (alhamdulillah waktu SMA, gue hampir selalu puas dengan pencapaian-pencapaian gue), dan pas menghadapi kenyataan nggak diterima undangan ini, rasanya kayak kena tampar bahwa yang kita inginkan nggak harus selalu terjadi, dan yang terjadi nggak selalu harus yang kita inginkan. Haha XD</p><p>Bisa dibilang karena gue nggak diterima lewat undangan lah, gue berusaha abis-abisan ngejar SNMPTN Jalur Tertulis. Tapi bedanya untuk SNMPTN Tertulis itu, gue siap untuk tidak berhasil. Gue siap menerima kenyataan kalau gue nggak keterima juga. Siap untuk tidak berhasil bukan berarti lo menolak untuk berhasil. Malah dengan kesiapan itu, usaha gue lebih gue kerahkan untuk mengejar apa yang dinamakan &#x2018;keberhasilan&#x2019;.</p><p>Dan menjelang SNMPTN Tertulis, nyokap masih menghibur gue sekaligus memberi pesan bahwa gagal itu biasa. Tapi gue bilang &#x201C;aku nggak gagal ma, aku cuman belum berhasil aja&#x201D;.</p><p>Jadi intinya, modal gue untuk mencapai &#x2018;keberhasilan&#x2019; adalah keseimbangan antara optimisme dalam mencapai keberhasilan itu sendiri dan juga kesiapan untuk menghadapi kegagalan nantinya. Anggap saja kegagalan itu adalah titik refleksi (<em>reflection point</em>) yang siap mengantar lo ke keberhasilan yang ada di masa depan.</p><p>Semoga tulisan ini memberi inspirasi dan membuat orang-orang untuk lebih semangat menjalani dan menikmati hidup. Karena hidup ini terlalu indah, kawan &#x1F604; </p><p>&#x2013;zero&amp;one,</p><p>Enreina A. Rizkiasri</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
