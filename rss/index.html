It was not an overnight decision. On the contrary, I came to the decision after a constant self-doubt, built up over the last 3-4 years throughout my master study and my day-to-day job as a software engineer.</p><p>The burning questions were, and probably still are: <em>What am I, if I am not a software engineer? What do I do if software engineering, and might as well, tech in general, is stripped away from me?</em></p><p>I have been a self-proclaimed tech enthusiast for most of my life. In high school &#x2014; or even way before &#x2014; I always knew that I wanted to have an occupation in the tech industry, not specifically as a software engineer, but I knew I wanted to do <em>coding</em> for a living. But not long after I could proudly say &#x201C;I am a software engineer&#x201D;, I started to have some self-doubts &#x2014; I wasn&#x2019;t really sure if I really wanted, or suited, to work in the tech industry for a lifetime.</p><p>I just lost the spark and the enjoyment that I used to have when I code to build things. It was not fun any more. I didn&#x2019;t know when it started being a burden, but at one point, every morning I wake up, I dread the thought of having to work like this for my whole life. I tried to convince myself that working is not always about fun, it&#x2019;s just a part of being an adult<em>.</em> However, there is always an inner voice that says that it wouldn&#x2019;t be fair to anyone, especially myself, if I continue to work like that.</p><p>I realize that if I do find the answer to the question &#x201C;What am I? What do I do (<em>for a living</em>)?&#x201D; &#x2013; I would then attach a one label to myself, and it may lead to the same dilemma with how I&apos;ve labelled myself as a software engineer. A dilemma on how I see myself as someone that couldn&apos;t do anything at all outside the tech world. That was the main thing that has been holding me back from quitting the tech industry &#x2014; I was afraid that I would be nothing if that one sole skill was stripped away from me.</p><p>So, after trying to hold on for quite some time, I decided to take a leap of faith and pluck up the courage to take a break from my career. Although, I wouldn&#x2019;t say I have &#x201C;quit&#x201D; the tech industry, I&#x2019;m still glad that I had the resolve to let go. Letting go for me means resigning from a really decent job overseas and moving back to my home country, with a vague plan on what to do next.</p><p>So, here I am. Back to square one. </p><p>However, once I put out software engineering out of the equation, it&#x2019;s easier to realize that I do have other things that I could do &#x2014; or for a better phrasing &#x2014; things that I <em>would</em> like to do.</p><p>It turns out that I enjoy doing many kind things, from reading books, playing the piano, watching movies &amp; animation, to learning a language. I am no expertise at any of these things, but I enjoy them nonetheless. The interest come and go as a cycle &#x2014; one time I could really spend a whole week on learning a piece on the piano, and then I could spend another week to try to read a <em>manga</em> in Japanese.</p><p>After around 4 months being unemployed, with the first 2 months spent on travelling and getting settled back to my home country, a daily routine started to settle. My days are filled with things I sincerely enjoy doing &#x2013; starting my day with a morning walk, brewing a cup of coffee, taking a course on music theory, brushing up my Japanese, and so on.</p><p>I am still not quite sure where all of this will take me, but in order to have some kind of progress tracker, I started to write a daily <em>sabbatical</em> journal about the things I do and learn every day. The journal helps to give myself an affirmation that I&#x2019;m, slowly, but still, moving forward. </p><p>The reboot of this blog is, in a way, an expanded version of that journal. I want to have some kind of medium to output my thoughts and findings. </p><p>My writings would be personal, as they are intended to be, but I do hope they can somehow appeal to any readers who share some of my interests, that&apos;s why I decided to publish them as a blog. I&#x2019;ll try my best to give appropriate tags to the posts, so an interested reader can easily find things that are relevant to them.</p><hr><p>That&apos;s it for the first post of my revamped blog. Please do look forward to my upcoming posts &#x1F642;</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[To Be an MSc Student or Not to Be, That Is the Question — or Is It?]]></title><description><![CDATA[How much time should you be committed to something so you can claim yourself as “a commmited person”?

I have 2 real work experiences listed on my CV (real as in employed by a certain company), and the longest one was my most recent one prior to my master study: 1.5 years of working as a software engineer for a friend-turned-into-CEO&#x2019;s startup company.</p><p>The first few months of work were exciting for me, I got to learn new things every day with new challenges to solve. But then &#x2014; as clich&#xE9; as it may seem &#x2014; nothing lasts forever. The excitement tones down as every day&#x2019;s activities turn into routines, and I feel like my skill set was not growing. It&#x2019;s just the same thing I had to do every day. It was boredom.</p><h3 id="msc-as-an-alternative-%E2%80%9Ccareer%E2%80%9D-path">MSc as an Alternative &#x201C;Career&#x201D; Path</h3><p>That was when I started to consider taking another path: taking a master degree. Again, my reason was not solely because &#x201C;I want to gain more knowledge..and so on&#x201D; (well it is true to some extent), but it was mostly because I felt stuck on the same position and needed a change of pace.</p><p>So that&#x2019;s why I decided to take a chance by working on my application to an MSc programme. As I wasn&#x2019;t really sure on what specialization that I would want to take back then, I slimmed down my university options to one &#x2014; <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/">TU Delft</a> &#x2014; which offers an <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/onderwijs/opleidingen/masters/cs/msc-computer-science/">MSc in Computer Science programme</a> without strict specialization (at least when we start, by the second year we need to decide in which research group we&#x2019;d like to work our thesis in).</p><p>Then, I also started to seek possible scholarship options, back then the options were either <a href="https://www.lpdp.kemenkeu.go.id/">LPDP</a>, Beasiswa Menkominfo, and <a href="https://www.tudelft.nl/en/education/practical-matters/scholarships/justus-louise-van-effen-excellence-scholarships/">TU Delft Excellence Scholarship</a>. Note that taking an MSc degree without scholarship would not be an option for me, it was way more reasonable for me to figure out how to not get bored in my job while being paid, rather than spending a fortune for a Master degree just to be &#x201C;not bored&#x201D;.</p><p>There was another condition which I imposed on myself: I had to work as hard as possible to get accepted &#x2014; if by the end I didn&#x2019;t get admitted and/or didn&#x2019;t acquire a scholarship, I would take it as a sign that MSc was not the way for me.</p><h3 id="results">Results?</h3><p>I honestly felt really lucky back then: the first time was when I got my acceptance letter and the second time was when my scholarship application got nominated and eventually be selected as one of the Excellence Scholarship recipients. My application for the Menkominfo scholarship was in fact got rejected, which I almost took a sign to give up on my pursuit towards a graduate study.</p><h3 id="takeaways">Takeaways</h3><p>This post is not the kind of post like &#x201C;many failures come before success&#x201D; type of post. This post is just to show that sometimes you don&#x2019;t really need a strong &#x201C;why&#x201D; to do something. You <em>just have to do it</em> &#x2014; even boredom can be the most &#x2018;logical&#x2019; reason for you to take a step forward.</p><blockquote>Sometimes for some people, you don&#x2019;t have to have a &#x201C;reason&#x201D; to take a graduate degree (or any other life choices). &#x201C;Just because.&#x201D;</blockquote><p>No, I am not saying that you should take a master degree if you&#x2019;re bored with your current job (<em>gosh,</em> you should be grateful you actually have a job). A master degree is not for everyone. It is also not necessary. It&#x2019;s just if you feel stuck &#x2014; just like me back then &#x2014; do check your available options.</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Sakura]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>What&#x2019;s your reason for coming to japan?<br><br>I want to see the cherry blossom blooms in Japan with my own eyes.</p><p>And yes the dream was worth a wait.

Seeing sakura for me is like seeing lanterns for Rapunzel (yes I am referring to Disney&#x2019;s movie, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907/http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0398286/">Tangled</a>).</p><blockquote><em><strong>Rapunzel</strong>: I&#x2019;ve been looking out of a window for eighteen years, dreaming about what I might feel like when those lights rise in the sky.

Let&#x2019;s get on to some photos! My favorite photos were taken along Kanda River (&#x795E;&#x7530;&#x5DDD;) from Takaido Station to Meidaimae Station. It was around 4.5 km (one and a half hour walking if you often stop and take some photos) between those stations and it was an amazing morning walk to see and experience showers of sakura petals.</p><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4495-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Sakura along the Kanda River." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sakura along the Kanda River.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/https://dl.pushbulletusercontent.com/DUQZ5EI90sQXDvPTKf74cjlzeoWqPvxV/IMG_20150406_075620.jpg" class="kg-image" alt loading="lazy"><figcaption>It&#x2019;s like a scene out of an anime.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4532-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Close up version of pale pink version of sakura" loading="lazy"><figcaption>Close up version of pale pink version of sakura</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4556-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="Sakura petals shower make the road look like it&apos;s covered with pink carpet." loading="lazy"><figcaption>Sakura petals shower make the road look like it&#x2019;s covered with pink carpet.</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4563-e1428329748228-225x300.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="&apos;Weeping&apos; sakura" loading="lazy"><figcaption>&#x2018;Weeping&#x2019; sakura</figcaption></figure><figure class="kg-card kg-image-card kg-card-hascaption"><img src="https://web.archive.org/web/20150801101907im_/http://enreina.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/IMG_4568-300x225.jpg" class="kg-image" alt="A pinker version" loading="lazy"><figcaption>A pinker version</figcaption></figure><p>Other than Kanda River, I also went to Ueno Park (just strolling along the park, because it was too crowded to sit down), Asukayama Park (hanami with several YSEP students), and also just today I went to Yoyogi Park (hanami with other several YSEP students). Oh there are actually also some cherry blossom in Tokodai (Ookayama campus). I didn&#x2019;t take many photos at those places and were just enjoying the blissful moment.

So yeah basically I am going to start writing in English from time to time especially when writing about my story here in Japan as a YSEP Student. I was putting off this blogging in English thing for weeks now because I feel most comfortable writing in &#x2018;informal&#x2019; Indonesian language (which I always use when I write previous posts in this blog), but for the sake for my blog to be read by non-Indonesian, I&#x2019;ll try my best.</p><p>If you are reading my blog for the first time (or you don&#x2019;t understand the previous posts which are in Indonesian), let me introduce myself for a bit.</p><p>My name is Enreina Annisa Rizkiasri, but people usually calls me Enreina or Reina (either is fine). I am currently a fourth year bachelor student in Faculty of Computer Science, Universitas Indonesia and also right now an exchange student at Tokyo Institute of Technology (Tokyo Tech or Tokodai). I am participating the Young Scientist Exchange Program Focused On Research and belongs to Murata Laboratory, Department of Computer Science in Tokodai. The program will last for a year so I have many things to blog about life as an exchange student in Japan.</p><p>So it has been like almost 50 days that I have been living in Yokohama-shi (it&#x2019;s actually 48 days, I know, I have been counting it with my phone&#x2019;s lock screen widget). I came to Japan on the 12th of September (and if you understand Indonesian and would like to know my first three days in the country, you should read my previous blog post) which is the day I arrived at Haneda Airport. I arrive there with three other YSEP students from Indonesia (Bima, Baim, and Antya) and was met by my Lab Tutor, Hosokane Aiko-san. There were actually two more YSEP students from Indonesia which are Dyah and Vidya. The first one, Dyah, is my roommate in the dorm and she had arrived a day earlier, while the later, Vidya, is Antya&#x2019;s roommate and arrived two weeks later.</p><p>In Yokohama-shi, I live in Umegaoka Dormitory (a dormitory for foreign Tokyo Tech students) which is located near Fujigaoka station (15 minutes walk from there actually if you walk moderately fast over hills, because yeah the road consists of up-hills and down-hills). It was tiring at first going back and forth between dorm and the station, but I got used to it right now and it&#x2019;s actually a nice habit. I kinda enjoy morning walks right now from the dorm to the station.</p><p>I got a double room in the dormitory (which I shared with Dyah), and the room is really nice and neat. There are also a microwave, a washing machine, a kitchen already in the room. So yeah, basically I already feel comfortable living in the dormitory.</p><p>From dormitory to Tokyo Tech O-okayama campus (intermezzo: the o in O-okayama &#xFF08;&#x5927;&#x5CA1;&#x5C71;&#xFF09;is actually three Os so it&#x2019;s pronounced really long like &#x201C;o-o-o&#x201D; haha) is around 1 hour by train. I had to take the Tokyu Den-en-toshi Line and change to the Tokyu Oimachi Line to reach O-okayama station from Fujigaoka station. It&#x2019;s not too far once I got used to commute here and there. And again I enjoy the time that I spend for my everyday&#x2019;s commute.</p><p>I actually have so many things to tell about living in Japan from my lab, shopping, eating, sightseeing, home stay, and much more! But I think it won&#x2019;t fit into this one post, so I&#x2019;ll just keep this one short (for introduction only).</p><p>See you!</p>]]></content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Saat Kuliah Menjadi Hobi]]></title><description><![CDATA[<p>Akhirnya muncul lagi di blog ini, dengan theme baru &#x1F600;</p><p>Gue baru saja menyelesaikan dua minggu pekan UTS Semester 4 lho.

Yep, gue udah berada di pertengahan semester 4, alias nggak lama lagi gue bakal jadi mahasiswa tingkat 3 di semester depan. Wow, memang kalau kita melakukan hal-hal yang menyenangkan, waktu terasa lebih cepat ya?</p><p>Nah ada apa ini dengan judul post-nya &#x201C;Saat Kuliah Menjadi Hobi&#x201D;? Ya itu dia, gue mau cerita tentang bagaimana gue sekarang menganggap kuliah itu menjadi hobi. Kuliah itu bisa dibilang sebagai passion gue sekarang. Kok bisa?</p><p>Jadi ceritanya, gue baru-baru ini baca tentang post ini: <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140112093533/http://rinaldimunir.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/pidato-wisudawan-terbaik-memukau-tetapi-sekaligus-menakutkan/">http://rinaldimunir.wordpress.com/2013/04/07/pidato-wisudawan-terbaik-memukau-tetapi-sekaligus-menakutkan/</a> yang kebetulan juga linknya sudah tersebar dan populer di media sosial seperti Twitter dan Facebook.</p><p>Dari pidato tersebut, gue langsung teringat bagaimana dulu gue sangat menentang kata-kata &#x201C;Kan yang penting nilainya ..&#x201D; dan seakan-akan semua kerja keras para pelajar hanya dapat dilihat dari nilai saja. Bahkan sejak SD, gue jadi memiliki rasa &#x2018;takut&#x2019; yang berlebihan akan nilai, dan hasilnya adalah gue keluar dari sekolah dasar saat awal kelas 5, dan memutuskan untuk <em>homeschool</em>.</p><p>Sayangnya, rasa &#x201C;takut&#x201D; itu masih terbawa sampai SMP, padahal nilai-nilai gue bisa dibilang baik-baik saja dan membuat orang-orang bingung apa yang membuat gue begitu takut.</p><p>Selama 10 tahun melalui &#x2018;pendidikan&#x2019; sebelum kuliah, <em>mindset</em> gue tentang sistem pendidikan di Indonesia yang salah belum hilang sepenuhnya. Gue menganggap pendidikan itu hal yang menyeramkan yang memaksa pelajar untuk mengejar satu objektif, yaitu nilai. Sedangkan menurut gue, bukankah pendidikan itu seharusnya menjadi fasilitas negara agar kita bisa merasakan betapa menyenangkan mencari ilmu itu?</p><p>Nah, baru setelah masuk ke kuliah, yang bisa dibilang jurusan yang gue ambil adalah <em>passion</em> gue, gue baru benar-benar merasakan bahwa ilmu itu menyenangkan, dan kuliah pun menjadi hobi bagi gue yang gue tunggu kejutan-kejutannya setiap hari. Gue nggak mau lagi menganggap nilai itu adalah segalanya, malahan nilai itu hanya menjadi patokan untuk lebih meningkatkan pemahaman. Apalagi di Ilmu Komputer, banyak banget ilmu yang gue dapet di luar dari perkuliahan itu sendiri &#x1F600;</p><p>Learning is supposed to be fun, right? &#x1F600;</p><p>-zero&amp;one,</p><p>Enreina A.

Malah kalau di-<em>flashback</em>, banyak banget kejadian-kejadian yang waktu itu rasanya gue udah nggak ada harapan lagi, tapi toh malah sekarang gue malah mikir-mikir gara-gara kejadian-kejadian itu lah gue jadi seperti yang sekarang ini. Optimis dan penuh determinasi.</p><p>Kalau yang baru-baru ini terjadi (sebenernya udah hampir setengah tahun yang lalu) adalah &#x2018;gagal&#x2019;-nya gue diterima di PTN melalui SNMPTN Jalur Undangan. Yang ngebuat gue waktu itu merasa benar-benar gagal adalah bagaimana gue superrrrr banget berharap keterima lewat jalur itu, dan sama sekali nggak kepikiran bakal bisa melalui SNMPTN Jalur Tertulis. Awalnya, rasanya bener-bener hopeless deh. Mungkin juga karena gue jarang menghadapi kekecewaan-kekecewaan sebelumnya (alhamdulillah waktu SMA, gue hampir selalu puas dengan pencapaian-pencapaian gue), dan pas menghadapi kenyataan nggak diterima undangan ini, rasanya kayak kena tampar bahwa yang kita inginkan nggak harus selalu terjadi, dan yang terjadi nggak selalu harus yang kita inginkan. Haha XD</p><p>Bisa dibilang karena gue nggak diterima lewat undangan lah, gue berusaha abis-abisan ngejar SNMPTN Jalur Tertulis. Tapi bedanya untuk SNMPTN Tertulis itu, gue siap untuk tidak berhasil. Gue siap menerima kenyataan kalau gue nggak keterima juga. Siap untuk tidak berhasil bukan berarti lo menolak untuk berhasil. Malah dengan kesiapan itu, usaha gue lebih gue kerahkan untuk mengejar apa yang dinamakan &#x2018;keberhasilan&#x2019;.</p><p>Dan menjelang SNMPTN Tertulis, nyokap masih menghibur gue sekaligus memberi pesan bahwa gagal itu biasa. Tapi gue bilang &#x201C;aku nggak gagal ma, aku cuman belum berhasil aja&#x201D;.</p><p>Jadi intinya, modal gue untuk mencapai &#x2018;keberhasilan&#x2019; adalah keseimbangan antara optimisme dalam mencapai keberhasilan itu sendiri dan juga kesiapan untuk menghadapi kegagalan nantinya. Anggap saja kegagalan itu adalah titik refleksi (<em>reflection point</em>) yang siap mengantar lo ke keberhasilan yang ada di masa depan.</p><p>Semoga tulisan ini memberi inspirasi dan membuat orang-orang untuk lebih semangat menjalani dan menikmati hidup. Karena hidup ini terlalu indah, kawan &#x1F604; </p><p>&#x2013;zero&amp;one,</p><p>Enreina A. Rizkiasri</p>]]></content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
