            <p>The end of the year is the time when content with the theme “2022 Review” spawns everywhere in many kinds of forms: from articles, blog posts (like what you’re reading right now), Instagram highlights, and Spotify Wrapped, to anything we can think of.</p><p>While I am not someone who believes that the past 365 days are only worth it when we publish a summary of them, I believe this year is special. It’s a different kind of year for me, thus it deserves a retrospective of its own.</p><p>If you’ve read my <a href="https://enreina.com/blog/blog-reboot-what-am-i-if-i-am-not-a-software-engineer/">post</a> before — this year is the year I’m not in any kind of formal employment or education. While the term I use as an excuse is “career break” or “sabbatical” — but really, let’s say blatantly that it’s my unemployment year. This may sound as selfish (and it is!): it’s the year I got to do what I want to do.</p><p>And what did I get out of “doing things I want to do”? Below, I break down the highlights of my unemployment year.</p><h3 id="japanese-learning">Japanese Learning</h3><p>This one could probably be a standalone post, but I spent most of my waking days this year improving my Japanese. Here’s my accomplishment:</p><p><strong>Passed the JLPT N3.</strong> I managed to pass the Japanese Language Proficiency Test (JLPT) N3 which is equivalent to, if I quote the linguistic competence at the back of my certificate, “<em>The ability to understand Japanese used in everyday situations to a certain degree</em>”.</p><p>That being said, I didn’t pass with flying colors, and I still think I was just lucky — but still, it gives me a self-affirmation of my effort. On top of that, I also attempted the N2 level in December. The result hasn’t been out, and I’m not sure about passing this one, but one can only hope, can they?</p><p><strong>Learned +1000 Kanji &amp; +3000 Vocabulary</strong>. I couldn’t do this without the amazing web app: <a href="https://wanikani.com">WaniKani</a>. If I could afford the subscription back then, I should’ve started WaniKani a long time ago. I managed to reach Level 35 (out of 60) in 49 weeks, and the result is apparent whenever I came across a Japanese text in the wild. I still need to “focus” and slowly read, but if I try, I could recognize most of the kanji I see. Hopefully, I can clear out all remaining levels in 2023.</p><p><strong>Finished 1 Japanese novel</strong>. 1 seems a few, but I deserve to put it here because it’s the first Japanese novel (not a graded reader nor a manga) I’ve ever finished. I did have the aid of its audiobook, but it’s an accomplishment nevertheless (I posted a review of the book <a href="https://enreina.com/blog/book-review-mata-onaji-yume-wo-miteita/">here</a>). On top of that, I’ve started reading a couple of other Japanese novels — but have put them on pause for now. Hopefully, I can finish them in 2023 and read more Japanese novels as well.</p><p><strong>Had a few Japanese conversations</strong>. I mentioned before in my <a href="https://enreina.com/blog/how-i-build-a-habit-to-level-up-my-japanese-and-passed-the-jlpt-n3/">N3 review post</a> that I lack speaking abilities as I haven’t taken any Japanese lessons for a while. I am lucky this year that I got the chance to test out my speaking abilities: first in a trial lesson on <a href="https://www.italki.com/">italki</a> and the second one in some kind of recruiter interview (which I thought would be in English, but we ended talking full in Japanese for the whole 30 minutes).</p><p>This kind of 1-on-1 video call gives a boost of confidence whenever I could get my thoughts across in Japanese, and I could understand what the other party is saying. Although for an introvert like me, talking to people, especially in a foreign language is tiring, I do hope I could have enough courage (and money? lol) next year to get more chances to talk in Japanese.</p><h3 id="piano-arrangement-covers">Piano Arrangement &amp; Covers</h3><p>I started picking up the piano keyboard again last year, in the despair of pandemic isolation. I already had an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/depianoenreina/">Instagram account</a> dedicated to my piano recordings, and I posted videos there once in a while. This year, I decided to take things up a notch:</p><p><strong>Started a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@depianoenreina">YouTube channel</a>.</strong>  I started the channel in April, and by the end of the year, I’d managed to produce and upload a total of <strong>49 piano videos</strong> consisting of <strong>23 full videos</strong> and <strong>26 YouTube Shorts</strong>. The 50th video is still a work in progress, though I think it’ll be finished in 2023.</p><p>The channel has gained a shy number of <strong>+200 subscribers</strong> with <strong>+50K total views</strong> and <strong>+500 hours of watch time</strong>. More importantly, I enjoy the whole process of producing the videos — from working on the arrangement, practicing the piece, recording, editing, and publishing. Hopefully, I can produce more piano covers and keep growing the channel next year.</p><p><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong><strong>One TikTok video gained +46K views in 2 days</strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong></strong>. I also started a TikTok account to upload short videos, as a means to widen my audience. One day I uploaded this short simple piano cover (right hand only) of a popular song from the Japanese duo YOASOBI. I also added a “falling piano blocks” effect on the video (just see it <a href="https://vt.tiktok.com/ZS869TMPh/">here</a> if I described it poorly). Over 2 days, suddenly the video views shot up to +40K, and now I could not avoid doing a full version of the song (which I’m still working on right now).</p><p><strong>Published 12 piano solo arrangements on </strong><a href="https://musescore.com/user/53154402"><strong>MuseScore</strong></a><strong>.</strong> I managed to finish the arrangement of 12 songs (mostly TV-size versions of anime openings or endings), and I’m really glad that people are adding them as their favorites on MuseScore. I hope I can work on longer songs next year, and maybe, someday publish an original composition as well.</p><h3 id="getting-back-into-coding">Getting Back into Coding</h3><p>I know. I mentioned in my previous <a href="https://enreina.com/blog/blog-reboot-what-am-i-if-i-am-not-a-software-engineer/">post</a> that I would like to stay away from coding for a while while I’m on this career break. But it turns out I missed it more than I thought I would. This time tho it’s different — I write code for my own satisfaction, so it’s less burden and more enjoyable. Also, I rediscover the joy of solving problems and building things, which I used to really enjoy back in my university and early career days.</p><p><strong>LeetCode Grind; Earned 3 “study plan” badges on LeetCode</strong>. Around August, I decided to really start getting back into coding slowly. I started the journey by starting to grind my problem-solving skill on LeetCode. For those who are not familiar with LeetCode — it’s an online platform for practicing coding problems, designed to prepare yourself for coding interviews. I worked on a couple of LeetCode <a href="https://leetcode.com/study-plan/">study plans</a> — solving a total of <strong>132 problems</strong>.</p><p><strong>Developed <em><a href="https://ichibunzutsu.vercel.app/">Ichi Bun Zutsu</a></em>, a web app for Japanese reading practice</strong>. While I do enjoy the satisfaction that comes from doing LeetCode daily, I also want to refine my technical skill by learning something more practical. I pick up TypeScript and Next.js and decided to build a web app that overlaps with my other interest — Japanese learning. While it’s only a hobby project, I did really enjoy thinking through the features, designing the UI, and planning a simple architecture, while learning a lot of things along the way. The web app is available <a href="https://ichibunzutsu.vercel.app/">here</a>, and the source code is available <a href="https://github.com/enreina/ichibunzutsu">here</a>. Currently, I still have a few other planned features in mind, which I hope I can start working on in 2023.</p><p><strong>Brush up on interview skills</strong>. Getting back into coding gives me some epiphany that I might want to return to the workforce sooner rather than later. I’m not giving myself any strict deadline, but I’ve been getting more chances to attend a few interviews, in the form of technical, and behavioral interviews, as well as live coding sessions. I haven’t had any offers yet as of now, but I’ll keep improving myself and focus on doing my best.</p><p>I’m still not sure where would I be in 2023 as a software engineer, there are several options I have in mind: maybe working for a company, maybe starting working as a freelancer, or maybe starting a journey of becoming a solopreneur. Who knows? I’ll do what I know I can do for now and see where the path goes.</p><hr><p>Overall, 2022 was a unique, one-of-a-kind year for me. I got to wear many hats and start defining myself as someone who enjoys multiple things rather than just one label. I hope I can continue doing things I enjoy next year. Surely though, there might be a time, one day, that I might not enjoy the things I enjoy right now — but I’ll surely remember 2022 as a time that I did enjoy them.</p>
