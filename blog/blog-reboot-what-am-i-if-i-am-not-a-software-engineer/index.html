            <p>6 months ago, I resigned from my job and decided to take an indefinite break from my software engineering career. It was not an overnight decision. On the contrary, I came to the decision after constant self-doubt, built up over the last 3‚Äì4 years throughout my master's study and my day-to-day job as a software engineer.</p><p>The burning questions were, and probably still are: <em>What am I, if I am not a software engineer? What do I do if software engineering, and might as well, tech in general, is stripped away from me?</em></p><p>I have been a self-proclaimed tech enthusiast for most of my life. In high school‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor even way before‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI always knew that I wanted to have an occupation in the tech industry, not specifically as a software engineer, but I just wanted to <em>code</em> for a living. But not long after I could proudly say ‚ÄúI am a software engineer‚Äù, I started to have some self-doubts‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI‚Äôm not really sure if I want or am suited, to work in the tech industry for a lifetime.</p><p>I just lost the spark and the enjoyment that I used to have when I code to build things. It was not fun anymore. I didn‚Äôt know when it started being a burden, but at one point, every morning I woke up, I dread the thought of having to work like that for the rest of my life. I tried to convince myself that working is not always about having fun, it‚Äôs just a part of being an adult<em>.</em> However, there was always an inner voice that kept saying that it wouldn‚Äôt be fair to anyone, especially myself if I continue to work like that.</p><p>Then I realized: if I do end up with the answer to the question, ‚ÄúWhat am I? What do I do ( <em>for a living</em>)?‚Äù, I would then label myself solely as one thing‚Ää‚Äî‚Äämy job‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääand it would lead to the same problem with how I‚Äôve labeled myself as a software engineer until now. I see myself as someone who couldn‚Äôt do anything at all outside the tech world. That was the main thing that has been holding me back from quitting the tech industry‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI was afraid that I would be nothing if that one sole identity was stripped away from me.</p><p>So, after trying to hold on for quite some time, I decided to take a leap of faith and pluck up the courage to take a break from my career. Although I wouldn‚Äôt say I have ‚Äúquit‚Äù the tech industry, I‚Äôm still glad that I had the resolve to let go. For me at that time, letting go means resigning from a well-paying job overseas and moving back to my home country.</p><p>So, there I was. Back to square one. Unsure of what to do next.</p><p>However, once I put software engineering out of the equation, it‚Äôs easier to realize that I do have other things that I could do‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääor for a better phrasing‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääthings that I <em>would</em> like to do.</p><p>It turns out that I enjoy doing many kinds of things, from reading books, playing the piano, watching movies &amp; animation, to learning a language. I am no expert at any of these things, but I enjoy them nonetheless. The interest comes and goes as a cycle‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääone time I could really spend a whole week learning a piece on the piano, and then I could spend another week trying to read a <em>manga</em> in Japanese.</p><p>After around 6 months of being unemployed, with the first 2 months spent on traveling and getting settled back in my home country, I gradually settled into a routine. My days are filled with things I sincerely enjoy doing. I start my day with a morning walk, then brew a cup of coffee, take a course on music theory, brush up my Japanese, and so on. I really feel that the weight on my shoulder has been lifted‚Ää‚Äî‚ÄäI could now take my time to do the things that I <em>want</em> to do and not the things that I <em>have </em>to do.</p><p>However, I am still not quite sure where all of this will take me, so there is still some anxiety left about the future. That‚Äôs why I try to have some kind of progress tracker by writing a <em>sabbatical</em> journal about the things I do and learn every day. The journal helps me to give a self-affirmation that I am still moving forward, albeit slowly.</p><p>The reboot of this blog is, in a way, an expanded version of that journal. I want to have some kind of medium to output my thoughts and findings.</p><p>My writings would be personal, as they are intended to be, but I do hope they can somehow appeal to any readers who share some of my interests, that‚Äôs why I decided to publish them as a blog. I‚Äôll try my best to give appropriate tags to the posts, so an interested reader can easily find things that are relevant to them.</p><hr><p>It seems, on the surface, that I have wasted my years of effort‚Ää‚Äî‚Ääon pursuing my master's degree abroad and securing a decent job. But I try to not think about it that way. The experience has helped me to realize that there is more to life than just one single goal or occupation. I want to treat myself better by giving myself a chance to take a break from all the stress and explore other things outside the tech industry. I just want to have faith that all of these would lead to something: either recovering my passion for tech or paving the way to an entirely different career path.</p>
