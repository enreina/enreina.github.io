Hi, I am **Enreina**, a software engineer. However, I'm currently taking a career break. Previously, I worked at Uber in Amsterdam.

Outside of being a software engineer, I usually pick up one of my next favorite activites: watching movies/drama series, reading [novels](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/2945063-enreina), enjoying (or taking photos of) [food](https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/18132363679005219/), co-hosting my podcast series: [conn:podcast](https://connpodcast.github.io/), or playing my [piano keyboard](https://www.instagram.com/depianoenreina/).
